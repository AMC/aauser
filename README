This includes the basic register, login and log out functionality.

I plan on adding password reset and account editing.

This system creates the following variables:
  $_SESSION['userid']     -   The user id
  $_SESSION['email']      -   The user's email
  $_SESSION['first_name'] -   The user's first name
  $_SESSION['last_name']  -   The user's last name
  $_SESSION['zip_code']   -   The user's zip code
  $_SESSION['role']       -   The user's role - user this to determine access in your application
  $_SESSION['logged_in']  -   The user's status - either TRUE or FALSE
  $_SESSION['flash']      -   An array used to pass messages throughout the application, it is displayed in the layout
